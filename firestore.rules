/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for CalorieWise AI application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user can only access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, ensuring clear ownership and preventing unauthorized access.
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 * - /users/{userId}/meals/{mealId}: Stores meal data for each user.
 * - /users/{userId}/weeklyTargets/{weeklyTargetId}: Stores weekly calorie targets for each user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own user document and associated meals and weekly targets.
 * - Listing all users is disallowed. Only the authenticated user can access their own data.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The 'userId' is embedded in the path for both meals and weeklyTargets, and is also present as a field in the document.
 * This enables efficient security rules that avoid costly get() calls.
